# Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)

This directory is the central repository for all Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for the project.

## Purpose

PRDs serve as the authoritative source of truth for feature requirements, design specifications, and implementation guidelines. All new features or major changes should have an associated PRD here.

## Structure

To keep this folder organized, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Naming Convention**: Use kebab-case for filenames, e.g., `user-authentication.md`.
2. **Template**: When creating a new PRD, consider including the following sections:
   - **Overview**: High-level summary of the feature.
   - **Goals/Objectives**: What are we trying to achieve?
   - **User Stories**: Who is this for and how will they use it?
   - **Functional Requirements**: Detailed list of features.
   - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, etc.
   - **UI/UX Designs**: Links to Figma or screenshots.
   - **Technical Implementation**: Architecture notes, database schema changes, API endpoints.
